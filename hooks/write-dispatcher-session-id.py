SessionStart hook: write the dispatcher session ID to the marker file.

Fires on SessionStart (non-compact) for ALL sessions that inherit
LOBSTER_MAIN_SESSION=1 (the dispatcher and all subagents it spawns).
Only the dispatcher path performs any action; subagent sessions are
silently ignored.

## Dispatcher path

When the marker file is absent (fresh dispatcher start), the current
session_id matches the stored dispatcher ID, or the stored dispatcher session
has ended (its .jsonl file is gone from ~/.claude/projects/), writes
session_id to ~/messages/config/dispatcher-session-id. This file is the
primary signal that other hooks use to distinguish the dispatcher from
subagents.

## Subagent sessions

Subagent sessions are not acted on by this hook. The correct discipline is for
the dispatcher to call `register_agent` before spawning via `Task()`. A
SessionStart-based stub cannot know the real `chat_id` — it would always write
`chat_id='0'`, which is useless for notification and creates ghost session rows
that cause reconciler noise. The ghost detector (`agent-monitor.py`) can find
unregistered sessions via the filesystem without needing a DB stub.

## Dispatcher DB registration (issue #781)

When the hook determines the current session IS the dispatcher, it also writes
a row to agent_sessions.db with agent_type='dispatcher'. This row is permanent
insurance: even if a future crash causes _is_dispatcher_session() to
misclassify a restart as a subagent, the reconciler's dispatcher-type skip
guard (added in the same issue) will still prevent agent_failed from being
emitted for any session tagged 'dispatcher'.


## Dispatcher DB registration (issue #781)

When the hook determines the current session IS the dispatcher, it also writes
a row to agent_sessions.db with agent_type='dispatcher'. This row is permanent
insurance: even if a future crash causes _is_dispatcher_session() to
misclassify a restart as a subagent, the reconciler's dispatcher-type skip
guard (added in the same issue) will still prevent agent_failed from being
emitted for any session tagged 'dispatcher'.

## Stale marker recovery

If the dispatcher crashes or is killed without a clean `lobster stop`, the
marker file retains the dead session's ID. On the next start, the new
dispatcher's session_id won't match and would normally be misclassified as a
subagent. This hook detects that the stored session's .jsonl file no longer
exists and correctly classifies the new session as the replacement dispatcher.
The primary defence against this scenario is `lobster stop` (and `restart`)
clearing the marker file; this check is a secondary safety net.

## settings.json configuration

Add this to ~/.claude/settings.json under "hooks" → "SessionStart":

    {
      "matcher": "",
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "python3 $HOME/lobster/hooks/write-dispatcher-session-id.py",
          "timeout": 5
        }
      ]
    }

The empty-string matcher fires on every SessionStart event (both fresh starts
and compact events). The compact variant is already handled by on-compact.py
via a "compact" matcher — the two hooks can coexist safely.
