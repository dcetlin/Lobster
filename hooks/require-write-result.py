"""
Stop hook: ensure subagents call write_result before exiting.
Injects a reminder if write_result was not called during the session.

Dispatcher sessions (detected via session_role.is_dispatcher()) are exempt —
the dispatcher never calls write_result, so the check only applies to subagents.

When write_result was called, this hook also marks the session completed in
agent_sessions.db synchronously — without relying on the unreliable server-side
auto-unregister path in inbox_server.py.
